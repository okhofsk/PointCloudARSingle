As virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming more and more common, and as new improvements are being released to make it more accurate and more engaging, point clouds are becoming increasingly relevant. With the Kinect [1] and other devices like it, it is becoming easier to capture point cloud data to construct 3D objects. They are used to help certain 3d polygon-rendering algorithms to quickly update. Quickly they are becoming a viable alternative for 3D applications such as, augmented reality, virtual reality and other 3D-visualization processes. 
As such having metrics to evaluate the quality of point clouds is paramount to advance further in the field. There has not been a lot of research as point clouds are quite new. As such having the tools to perform experiments in this domain would greatly improve the understanding when it comes to point clouds visualization.
